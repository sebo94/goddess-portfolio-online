## Optimizations

1. Change libraries to smaller ones based on needs (parallax (pure css/js), infinite carousel, aos(alternative: scroll out), Isotope(can use pure css))
2. Image optimizations (quality, sizes, metatags, cdns)
3. Lazy loading components
4. Refactor code/data files
5. Other devices versions
6. Cross platform compatibility
7. Integrate a spinner for loadings
