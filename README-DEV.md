## Optimizations

1. Change libraries to smaller ones based on needs (parallax, infinite carousel, aos(alternative: scroll out), Isotope(can use pure css))
2. Image optimizations (quality, sizes, metatags, cdns)
3. Lazy loading components
4. Refactor code/data files
5. Keep it DRY
6. Other devices versions
7. Cross platform compatibility

## Todos

1. Opacity on scroll?
2. Rework layout component structure (or remove it entirely)
3. Share my projects on socials
4. Navbar animation
5. Find a way to track who's sharing the projects
6. Add routing for projects and services
7. Hover effect on the grid
8. Animations on grid
9. Check access token validity and refresh it in case it's about to expire
